      <p>Many people seek out life coaches for guidance in navigating a significant life change, such as taking on a new
        career.

        life.

        Frequent irritability
        High levels of stress and/or anxiety
        Inability to break bad habits
        Lack of fulfillment in your social life
        Persistent feeling of dissatisfaction at work
